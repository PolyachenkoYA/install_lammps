# Installing and Running LAMMPS on the HPC Clusters

Below are a set of directions for building CPU and GPU versions of the code on the HPC clusters. LAMMPS can be built in many different ways. You may need to include additional packages when building the executable for your work. The build procedures below are just samples.

The next set of directions vary by cluster. Follow the directions below for the cluster of interest.

## Choose a cluster

* [Adroit (CPU)](adroit/scripts.md)
* [Adroit (GPU)](adroit/scripts.md)
* [Della-GPU](della-gpu/scripts.md)
* [Della CPU](della/scripts.md)
* [Stellar](stellar-intel/scripts.md)
* [TigerGPU](tigergpu/scripts.md)
* [TigerCPU](tigercpu/scripts.md)
* [Traverse](traverse/scripts.md)
